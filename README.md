Using the raspberry pi camera to capture images and record video
You are going to have play with the Camera.set values depending on what enviorment/lighting the car is in
Left easy to follow comments
Camera will auto-adjust exposure
Keep bitrate low to reduce lag
Keep resolution to what is already set, higher resolution will require more processing power from the raspberry pi. 
Keep the frames setting at 0, the frame should be around the 30's; higher frames means more processing power from the raspberry pi, can tend to overheat (above 90c).
